Leadership and collective action by migrant farmworkers throughout the 20th century have improved conditions, most recently with new national heat standards for outdoor workers and new protections against wage theft and labor trafficking for the temporary guest workers program.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EAdditional Reading\u003C\/h4\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETeoli, D., \u0026amp; Bhardwaj, A.

Risk Factor Surveillance System\u003C\/h4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a state-based random digit dial (RDD) telephone survey that is conducted annually in all states, the District of Columbia, and United States territories. Data obtained from the BRFSS are representative of each state\u0026rsquo;s total non-institutionalized population over 18 years of age and have included more than 400,000 annual respondents with landline telephones or cellphones since 2011. Data are weighted using iterative proportional fitting (also called \u0022raking\u0022) methods to reflect population distributions. Data from the BRFSS are used to measure various health behaviors and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) indicators in the Health Snapshots and downloadable datasets. HRQoL measures are age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrior to the 2016 Annual Data Release, up to seven survey years of landline only BRFSS data were aggregated to produce county estimates. However, even with multiple years of data, these did not provide reliable estimates for all counties, particularly those with smaller respondent samples. For the 2016 Annual Data Release and beyond, the CDC produced county estimates using single-year BRFSS data and a multilevel modeling approach based on respondent answers and their age, sex, and race\/ethnicity, combined with county-level poverty, as well as county- and state-level contextual effects.\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C\/sup\u003E To produce estimates for those counties where there were no or limited data, the modeling approach borrowed information from the entire BRFSS sample as well as Census Vintage population estimates. CDC used a parametric bootstrapping method to produce standard errors and confidence intervals for those point estimates. This estimation methodology was validated for all U.S. counties, including those with no or small (\u0026lt; 50 respondents) samples.\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C\/sup\u003E This same method was used in constructing the 500 cities study, which includes \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/places\/\u0022\u003EBRFSS data for the 500 largest cities in the U.S.\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the 2021 Annual Data Release, the CDC has updated their modeling procedure for producing small-area estimates.

Data obtained from the BRFSS are representative of each state\u2019s total non-institutionalized population over 18 years of age and have included more than 400,000 annual respondents with landline telephones or cellphones since 2011. Data are weighted using iterative proportional fitting (also called \u0022raking\u0022) methods to reflect population distributions. Data from the BRFSS are used to measure various health behaviors and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) indicators in the Health Snapshots and downloadable datasets. HRQoL measures are age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrior to the 2016 Annual Data Release, up to seven survey years of landline only BRFSS data were aggregated to produce county estimates. However, even with multiple years of data, these did not provide reliable estimates for all counties, particularly those with smaller respondent samples. For the 2016 Annual Data Release and beyond, the CDC produced county estimates using single-year BRFSS data and a multilevel modeling approach based on respondent answers and their age, sex, and race\/ethnicity, combined with county-level poverty, as well as county- and state-level contextual effects.\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C\/sup\u003E To produce estimates for those counties where there were no or limited data, the modeling approach borrowed information from the entire BRFSS sample as well as Census Vintage population estimates. CDC used a parametric bootstrapping method to produce standard errors and confidence intervals for those point estimates. This estimation methodology was validated for all U.S. counties, including those with no or small (\u0026lt; 50 respondents) samples.\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C\/sup\u003E This same method was used in constructing the 500 cities study, which includes \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/places\/\u0022\u003EBRFSS data for the 500 largest cities in the U.S.\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the 2021 Annual Data Release, the CDC has updated their modeling procedure for producing small-area estimates.

The Poor Physical Health Days estimates are produced from one year of survey data and are created using complex statistical modeling.

Beginning with the 2016 Annual Data Release, CDC has provided single-year modeled county-level estimates which include both landline and cell phone users. Beginning with the 2021 Annual Data Release, CDC introduced an updated modeling procedure to produce small-area estimates.

Modeling can increase the power of survey data by generating more stable estimates for places with small numbers of residents or survey responses.

This estimation methodology was validated for all U.S. counties, including those with no or small (\u0026lt; 50 respondents) samples.\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C\/sup\u003E This same method was used in constructing the 500 cities study, which includes \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/places\/\u0022\u003EBRFSS data for the 500 largest cities in the U.S.\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the 2021 Annual Data Release, the CDC has updated their modeling procedure for producing small-area estimates. With the PLACES project, a multilevel statistical modeling framework using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) is performed for small-area estimation that links BRFSS data with high spatial resolution population demographic and socioeconomic data from the Census\u2019 American Community Survey (ACS). The CDC has performed internal and external validation studies, which confirm strong consistency between their model-based estimates and the direct BRFSS survey estimates at both the state and county levels.

in all states, the District of Columbia, and United States territories. Data obtained from the BRFSS are representative of each state\u0026rsquo;s total non-institutionalized population over 18 years of age and have included more than 400,000 annual respondents with landline telephones or cellphones since 2011. Data are weighted using iterative proportional fitting (also called \u0022raking\u0022) methods to reflect population distributions. Data from the BRFSS are used to measure various health behaviors and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) indicators in the Health Snapshots and downloadable datasets. HRQoL measures are age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrior to the 2016 Annual Data Release, up to seven survey years of landline only BRFSS data were aggregated to produce county estimates. However, even with multiple years of data, these did not provide reliable estimates for all counties, particularly those with smaller respondent samples. For the 2016 Annual Data Release and beyond, the CDC produced county estimates using single-year BRFSS data and a multilevel modeling approach based on respondent answers and their age, sex, and race\/ethnicity, combined with county-level poverty, as well as county- and state-level contextual effects.\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C\/sup\u003E To produce estimates for those counties where there were no or limited data, the modeling approach borrowed information from the entire BRFSS sample as well as Census Vintage population estimates.

Data obtained from the BRFSS are representative of each state\u2019s total non-institutionalized population over 18 years of age and have included more than 400,000 annual respondents with landline telephones or cellphones since 2011. Data are weighted using iterative proportional fitting (also called \u0022raking\u0022) methods to reflect population distributions. Data from the BRFSS are used to measure various health behaviors and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) indicators in the Health Snapshots and downloadable datasets. HRQoL measures are age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrior to the 2016 Annual Data Release, up to seven survey years of landline only BRFSS data were aggregated to produce county estimates. However, even with multiple years of data, these did not provide reliable estimates for all counties, particularly those with smaller respondent samples. For the 2016 Annual Data Release and beyond, the CDC produced county estimates using single-year BRFSS data and a multilevel modeling approach based on respondent answers and their age, sex, and race\/ethnicity, combined with county-level poverty, as well as county- and state-level contextual effects.\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C\/sup\u003E To produce estimates for those counties where there were no or limited data, the modeling approach borrowed information from the entire BRFSS sample as well as Census Vintage population estimates. CDC used a parametric bootstrapping method to produce standard errors and confidence intervals for those point estimates. This estimation methodology was validated for all U.S. counties, including those with no or small (\u0026lt; 50 respondents) samples.\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C\/sup\u003E This same method was used in constructing the 500 cities study, which includes \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/places\/\u0022\u003EBRFSS data for the 500 largest cities in the U.S.\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the 2021 Annual Data Release, the CDC has updated their modeling procedure for producing small-area estimates.

For more technical information on the PLACES modeling procedure, please see their website.\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C\/sup\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C\/sup\u003EZhang X, Holt JB, Lu H, Wheaton AG, Ford ES, Greenlund K, Croft JB. \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/aje.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/179\/8\/1025.full.pdf+html?sid=664de759-c0e7-44db-8919-4addca353870\u0022\u003EMultilevel regression and poststratification for small-area estimation of population health outcomes: a case study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease prevalence using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\u003C\/a\u003E.

behaviors.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroups who have been historically marginalized by society often experience more barriers to engaging in health-promoting behaviors.

Education can create opportunities for better health through higher incomes, better employment options, increased social benefits and healthier behaviors. Education systems can support children\u0026rsquo;s development as members of a healthy community by teaching critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration and information literacy.

Students\u0026rsquo; ability to access a quality education is not distributed equitably because of historical and current policies and institutional practices that disadvantage people of color, families with lower incomes, students with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ students. For example, historical policies that segregated schools by race led to poorly funded schools for Black students. Currently, school discipline systems tend to disproportionately identify and punish students who are Black, have disabilities, are transgender, and are from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

This budget system created large gaps in educational resources and opportunities, with schools attended by students from wealthy neighborhoods having more resources than schools attended by students from low-income neighborhoods.

Education can create opportunities for better health through higher incomes, better employment options, increased social benefits and healthier behaviors. Education systems can support children\u2019s development as members of a healthy community by teaching critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration and information literacy. Health can also shape educational outcomes, such as when children with poor health have decreased attendance or concentration in class.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEducation systems also tend to reflect the broader context of health equity. Students\u2019 ability to access a quality education is not distributed equitably because of historical and current policies and institutional practices that disadvantage people of color, families with lower incomes, students with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ students. For example, historical policies that segregated schools by race led to poorly funded schools for Black students. Currently, school discipline systems tend to disproportionately identify and punish students who are Black, have disabilities, are transgender, and are from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This can result in expulsion or lost days of school for marginalized students.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone deserves a safe and nurturing learning environment that accommodates their needs.

In the first half of the 20th century, revenue generated by local property taxes covered over 80% of school spending. This budget system created large gaps in educational resources and opportunities, with schools attended by students from wealthy neighborhoods having more resources than schools attended by students from low-income neighborhoods. While school finance reforms have overall increased state contributions and reduced reliance on local funding through property taxes, connections between neighborhood wealth and school resources remain.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProviding resources for education for all students improves society for us all.

to health and equity\u003C\/h4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow we design and enact budgets can impact health directly by funding health promotion and disease prevention. Budgets also impact health by distributing funds that shape community conditions. For example, education funding improves educational attainment, which in turn improves health. After the 1896 Supreme Court ruling on Plessy v. Ferguson constitutionally sanctioned segregation of schools by race, schools for Black children received substantially less funding than white schools during the early 20th century. Rural schools struggle with retaining teachers due to lower salaries than urban schools, high transportation costs and a large proportion of students living below the poverty level \u0026ndash; all factors which impact educational outcomes and improve with funding.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch4\u003ERelationship to systems and structures\u003C\/h4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow we approach budgets support systems.

Elected officials make decisions on federal budgets for programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Section 8 that determine who in society is supported.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorldviews, culture and norms significantly impact how we form and implement budgets.

Legislators who have passed laws may be lauded for reform, but agencies mandated to implement unfunded programs may have to cut back on other programs that may be just as worthy. Also, if the program is not implemented well due to a lack of funds, the public may conclude that the policy is not helpful.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo decrease health inequity, we must target allocation of resources to repair the harms of those who have been most excluded.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EAdditional Reading\u003C\/h4\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHeller, J.

Budgets also impact health by distributing funds that shape community conditions. For example, education funding improves educational attainment, which in turn improves health. After the 1896 Supreme Court ruling on Plessy v. Ferguson constitutionally sanctioned segregation of schools by race, schools for Black children received substantially less funding than white schools during the early 20th century. Rural schools struggle with retaining teachers due to lower salaries than urban schools, high transportation costs and a large proportion of students living below the poverty level \u2013 all factors which impact educational outcomes and improve with funding.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch4\u003ERelationship to systems and structures\u003C\/h4\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow we approach budgets support systems. Decision-makers direct local, state or federal funding to agencies and institutions that carry out programs put in place by laws and policies. Elected officials make decisions on federal budgets for programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Section 8 that determine who in society is supported.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorldviews, culture and norms significantly impact how we form and implement budgets. Stories about crime that depict people of color and immigrants as criminals have contributed to increased governmental spending on policing and practices that surveille, arrest, convict and imprison Black people, Native American and other people of color at disproportionate rates to whites.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElected officials may pass laws and policies but not allocate any funding to implement them. Legislators who have passed laws may be lauded for reform, but agencies mandated to implement unfunded programs may have to cut back on other programs that may be just as worthy. Also, if the program is not implemented well due to a lack of funds, the public may conclude that the policy is not helpful.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo decrease health inequity, we must target allocation of resources to repair the harms of those who have been most excluded.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EAdditional Reading\u003C\/h4\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHeller, J.
